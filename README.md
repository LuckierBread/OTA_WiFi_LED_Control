This was a bigger undertaking than I thought. 

This is a webserver that hosts an HTML and CSS file using SPIFFS so it doesn't need a microSD.
All it does is display a web form that you can use to change the LED colors.

It also supports over-the-air updates which is pretty cool.
honestly, I learned a lot about how HTML and HTTP work. 
I think i want to try getting all this to run on the second core of the ESP32 so that it can handle requests while performing other tasks.
