This was a bigger undertaking than i thought. 

This is a webserver that hosts an HTML and CSS file using SPIFFS so it doesn't need a microSD
all it does is display a web form that you can use to change the led colors.

I guess it also supports over the air updates which is pretty cool.
honestly learned a lot about how html works and http work. 
I think i want to try getting all this to run on the second core of the ESP32 so that it can handle requests while performing other tasks.
